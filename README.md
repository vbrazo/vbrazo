### Hey folks! ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦

ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Vitor, a technology leader, builder, and problem solver passionate about AI automation, DevTools, and no-code platforms. Iâ€™ve spent years scaling engineering teams, developing products, and driving technical strategy, and now Iâ€™m focused on building high-impact tools that streamline workflows and enhance productivity.

ðŸ’¡ My expertise spans backend, frontend, mobile (iOS & Android), and AI-driven automation, but beyond the tech, I love tackling big challenges and finding practical, scalable solutions. Iâ€™m currently working on an AI agent prototype that helps talent professionals source top candidates on autopilotâ€”leveraging automation to make hiring smarter and more efficient.

ðŸŒ± Mentoring and coaching engineers and tech leaders has always been a huge part of my journey. Iâ€™ve hired, onboarded, and managed teams of all sizes, and I love helping others grow their skills, navigate career challenges, and build amazing things.

ðŸš€ My GitHub is a mix of open-source contributions, personal projects, and experimentsâ€”a reflection of my constant drive to learn, build, and push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible with technology. Letâ€™s connect and create something awesome!
