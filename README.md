### Hey folks! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Vitor. I've been using GitHub to host my repos and contribute to the open source community for many years. I'm a hands-on Software Engineering Leader with more than a decade of experience.

I have a lot of experience in different programming languages. SQL was my first language back in 2003 but I'm also fluent in Ruby, Python, Java, C++, and a myriad of scripting languages.

I'm a hacker at heart who has a purpose to make better tools and technologies for humanity in this life. I've been focused on mobile and full-stack web development, and I'm very passionate about people, startups, computers, and product management.

I also mentor junior developers and have invested a good amount of time helping them build their skill set in different technologies. I'm always proud to play the mentoring role because that's how I can give back what I was taught in the past. Seeing people succeeding in the development world is what makes me happy.

In my GitHub professional profile, you'll find many open source projects that I contribute to as well as my studying side projects where I work hard to become a better technologist.
